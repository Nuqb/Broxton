**`Software Engineering Student`**

I am currently a student studying software engineering. My main goal is to land an internship as a full-stack developer. All my projects are built from ground up and if you are reading this I am currently working on another project to publish to show my capabilities.

          <summary><h3>Programming Journey</h3></summary>
Ever since I can remember, I have loved creating and building. It didn’t really matter what it was—whether it was a paper airplane when I was bored in class or some cool-looking piece of wood from shop class. My fascination with programming began when I discovered mods for video games like Halo: Combat Evolved. It was fascinating to see how anyone could code something and change the game. That’s where I started. I turned on a computer and watched a YouTube tutorial on how to use the software, only to quickly realize that my ten-year-old brain had no idea what I was reading or doing.

Fast forward to high school, where I took a game development class and a web development class. When I wrote my first “Hello, World!” I immediately wanted to turn it into something I could be proud of. After starting university, I leaned toward the web development side of programming. Building web applications and working with databases felt extraordinary to me. Alongside my other classes, where I studied languages like Python and C/C++, I decided to revisit tinkering with Halo modding software. It was incredible to realize that I could now read hundreds of lines of code and change it however I wanted.

Now, I am exploring what projects I can create with a variety of programming languages and tools. I’ve spent hundreds of hours on assignments, but they don’t feel substantial enough to help me land a job. Realizing this, and after facing rejections from internships, I’ve decided to use my ambition to do everything I can to secure an internship for my final summer as a college student.
